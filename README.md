# JS Fun At A Restaurant

## Overview
I had a great experience working on this project. As a Mod1 repeater, it felt much more comfortable the second time around. The foundational principles 
and good habits in writing JavaScript functions have become much more solidified in my mind as a result. That being said, there were still a couple tricky 
assertions that took me some time to pass. Overall, I felt this project helped me with my JavaScript foundations.
